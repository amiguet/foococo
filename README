KMI's SoftStep Foot Controller is a very nice device, but to get the full power,
you need to use KMI's proprietary software.

This is an alternative to KMI's software, allowing to use the SoftStep with
unsupported systems (e.g. Linux).

It already provides a few functionnalities not available in KMI's software. If
you have a crazy idea about what you want to to with your SoftStep, this might
be the way to go.

Note that this is alpha-quality software. It works for me, but might brick your
computer, set fire to your SoftStep, drink all the beer and what not. Use at
your own risks.

To make it work, you'll need

- a recent python 2.x
- a recent version of pyo: http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/
- some creativity

The __main__ part of foococo.py shows how to use it.

Enjoy!
